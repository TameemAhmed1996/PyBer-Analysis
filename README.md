• Rural Cities Possess The Lowest Amount Of Drivers, Rides And Total Fares.

• Urban Cities Possess The Greatest Amount Of Drivers, Rides And Total Fares.

• Suburban Cities Possess The Second Greatest Amount Of Drivers, Rides And Total Fares After Urban Cities.

• Rural Cities Possess The Highest Average Fare Per Ride And The Highest Average Fare Per Driver.

Summary:

Here Are My Three Business Recommendations To The CEO:

1. Assign Drivers To The Types Of Cities That They Usually Operate In. 

2. Increase The Price Per Mile In Urban Cities Because Drivers Tend To Earn Less Per Trip In Them And Tend To Have Shorter Trip Durations In Them As Well.

3. Implement Changes In Charges Based On The Amount Of Riders In Cities During Different Months.
